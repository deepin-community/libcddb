libcddb (1.3.2-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control:
    - New maintainer. (Closes: #980305)
    - Add Vcs fields.
    - Update debhelper compatibility level to 13.
    - Remove Build-Depends: dh-autoreconf.
    - Update standards version to 4.5.1, no changes needed.
  * debian/patches:
    - Change the default server from freedb.org to gnudb.gnudb.org as the
      former is no longer available. (Closes: #952689)
    - Disable use of SIGALRM for DNS lookup as this is not thread-safe.
      Patch adapted from upstream VLC. (Closes: #928176)
    - Change encoding of THANKS to UTF-8 to fix lintian warning.
  * debian/compat:
    - Removed, using Build-Depends: debhelper-compat instead.
  * debian/not-installed:
    - Ignore .la files for dh_missing.
    - Ignore cddb_query utility not currently packaged.
  * debian/salsa-ci.yml:
    - Enable CI.
  * debian/libcddb2-dev.examples:
    - Removed useless makefiles from /usr/share/doc as they are generated by
      automake and so only work within the libcddb build tree. They also
      contain the full path to the build directory which makes the package
      unreproducible. The example program is trivial to compile anyway.
  * debian/libcddb2-dev.README.Debian:
    - Add a note on how to compile the example program.
  * debian/tests:
    - Add a simple autopkgtest that uses the cddb_query example program to
      query the default CDDB server.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Convert to machine readable format.
